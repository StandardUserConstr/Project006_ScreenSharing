GENERAL INFORMATION:
======================================================================================================================================
about program:
	this is an asynchronous multithreaded screen sharing program available in 32bit version under windows;
	program can open ports (server) and gives opportunity for another program (client) to connect throught the one;
	but to share server over global internet u need to forward your open port manually by using your router settings NAT,DMZ etc.

about hash:
	messages aren't hashed; if server activate hash,then hashed is paused image and frames of the screen; everything else is publicly accesable;

This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group. (libjpeg-turbo library to compress rgb pixel array into jpeg format and decompress)

INFORMATION ABOUT SETTINGS
======================================================================================================================================
CONFIG SHOULD BE CHANGES ONLY BY NOTEPAD OR ETC. THAT CAN HANDLE BINARY CHARACTERS AND SUCH BINARY OPERATIONS like notepad++ 'cause there are NULL characters that cannot be swapped with space characters for example; and only sector [config] should be changed;

[Config]
	"application_fps":
		1-480 == fps of graphic interface;
	"fastest/bad_quality_share":
		0-1 == OFF (0) or ON (1) making frame of screen by the server in fast quality mode;
	"inactive_timeout_in_ms":
		0-4294967295 == how often in milliseconds the server should send refresh signals to the client
				and how much time should waits until close connection with the client
				in case of inactivity;
	"compression_method_from_0_to_6":
		0 == 4:4:4 chrominance subsampling (no chrominance subsampling);
		1 == 4:2:2 chrominance subsampling;
		2 == 4:2:0 chrominance subsampling;
		3 == Grayscale;
		4 == 4:4:0 chrominance subsampling (not fully accelerated);
		5 == 4:1:1 chrominance subsampling (not fully accelerated);
		6 == 4:4:1 chrominance subsampling (not fully accelerated);
	"how_much_bytes_server_logs_must_have_to_delete_data":
		0-4294967295 == bytes that must have file "server_logs.txt" to be deleted
	"how_much_bytes_client_logs_must_have_to_delete_data":
		0-4294967295 == bytes that must have file "client_logs.txt" to be deleted


settings templates:
	lowest CPU load (in best quality scenario):
		quality: 10/10
		loss: 0 				//0 means disable
	lowest CPU load (generaly):
		loss: 0 				//0 means disable
		fastest/bad_quality_share: 1 		//have to change variable manually in config
	lowest internet load:
		quality: 1/10
		loss: 1
		the smallest width of the screen set by the server
		the smallest height of the screen set by the server

BUGS AND OTHERS
======================================================================================================================================
i'm aware of some problem in spectrum of logic structure of the program but i hope it won't bother majority of users;
